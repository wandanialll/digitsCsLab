A recreation of the Digits game by NY Times, written using Python and utilizing Tkinter and CustomTkinter for UI

Recreation of the game was made as a project for evaluation of a course.
Made by team of 4 led by myself. I was responsible for:

1. Game algorithm (with Christa Tracy Mojikon [Teammate])
2. User interface protoyping (with Izyann Alish [Teammate])
3. Creating a framework for teammates to work off via cloning repo
4. Debugging
5. Playtesting
6. Report writing
7. Creation of game assets

How the game works

1. Main algorithm driving the game

2. User then chooses a mixture of numbers and operations to achive the target number

Personal achievements
1. Deepen Python knowledge of syntax and included packages
2. Using Tkinter as for UI framing and CustomTkinter for more modern aesthethic
3. Created a custom algorithm for target number via creation of operations.
